🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as car age, present price, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven.

🔹 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze real-world car data and develop a reliable prediction system using supervised machine learning techniques.

🔹 Key Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering (Car Age calculation)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model comparison (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance

Model evaluation using R² score and error metrics

Feature importance and residual analysis

🔹 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🔹 Outcome

The Random Forest Regressor achieved better performance compared to other models, providing accurate predictions and meaningful insights into factors affecting car prices.

🔹 Future Enhancements

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit

Integrate real-time user input for predictions

Use advanced models like XGBoost

✨ This project was completed as part of a Data Science Internship and demonstrates practical application of machine learning concepts.
